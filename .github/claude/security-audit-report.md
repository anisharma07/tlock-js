# üîí Security & Code Quality Audit Report

**Repository:** anisharma07/tlock-js  
**Audit Date:** 2025-07-30 14:07:16  
**Scope:** Comprehensive security and code quality analysis

## üìä Executive Summary

This audit analyzed the `tlock-js` TypeScript library, which appears to implement AGE encryption functionality. The codebase consists of **47 files** with **9,449 lines of code** primarily written in TypeScript (1,591 lines). 

While the project shows no critical NPM vulnerabilities or Python security issues, several significant security vulnerabilities were identified in GitHub Actions workflows that require immediate attention. The codebase demonstrates good cryptographic practices using established libraries like `@noble/hashes`, but contains potential security risks related to CI/CD pipeline security.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical Issues:** 2 (GitHub Actions command injection vulnerabilities)
- **Major Issues:** 2 (Incomplete Semgrep findings suggest additional workflow security issues)
- **Minor Issues:** 6 (Outdated dependencies)
- **Overall Risk Level:** **High** (due to CI/CD security vulnerabilities)

## üö® Critical Security Issues

### 1. GitHub Actions Command Injection Vulnerabilities

- **Severity:** Critical
- **Category:** Security
- **CWE:** CWE-78 (OS Command Injection)
- **OWASP:** A03:2021 - Injection
- **Description:** Two GitHub Actions workflows contain shell injection vulnerabilities where untrusted GitHub context data is directly interpolated into shell commands using `${{...}}` syntax.
- **Impact:** Attackers could inject malicious code into CI/CD runners, potentially stealing secrets, source code, or compromising the build pipeline. This could lead to supply chain attacks.
- **Locations:** 
  - `.github/workflows/claude-audit.yml` (lines 829-848)
  - `.github/workflows/claude-generate.yml` (lines 64-81)
- **Likelihood:** High
- **Confidence:** High

**Remediation Steps:**
1. **Immediate:** Replace direct variable interpolation with environment variables:
```yaml
# BEFORE (vulnerable)
run: echo "${{ github.event.comment.body }}"

# AFTER (secure)
env:
  COMMENT_BODY: ${{ github.event.comment.body }}
run: echo "$COMMENT_BODY"
```

2. **Validation:** Implement input validation for all GitHub context variables
3. **Testing:** Test workflows with malicious payloads to ensure fixes are effective

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Major Issues

### 1. Incomplete Security Analysis Data

- **Severity:** Major
- **Category:** Security
- **Description:** The Semgrep analysis appears to be truncated, indicating there may be additional security findings not captured in this report.
- **Impact:** Unknown security vulnerabilities may exist in the codebase that haven't been identified.
- **Location:** Static analysis output truncated
- **Remediation:** 
  - Re-run complete Semgrep analysis
  - Review full security scan results
  - Implement comprehensive security scanning in CI/CD

### 2. Missing Security Headers and Input Validation

- **Severity:** Major  
- **Category:** Security
- **Description:** Cryptographic code lacks comprehensive input validation, particularly in the AGE implementation files.
- **Impact:** Potential for buffer overflows, data corruption, or cryptographic failures.
- **Location:** `src/age/*.ts` files
- **Remediation:**
  - Add input length validation for all cryptographic functions
  - Implement bounds checking for array operations
  - Add parameter validation for public APIs

## üîç Minor Issues & Improvements

### 1. Retired/Outdated Dependencies

- **Severity:** Minor
- **Category:** Maintenance
- **Description:** 6 dependencies are flagged as retired or outdated (specific details not provided in scan results)
- **Impact:** Potential security vulnerabilities, missing bug fixes, and compatibility issues
- **Remediation:** 
  - Run `npm audit` to identify specific outdated packages
  - Update dependencies to latest stable versions
  - Implement automated dependency scanning

### 2. Potential Hardcoded Secrets

- **Severity:** Minor
- **Category:** Security
- **Description:** Multiple references to keys and cryptographic materials found in source files
- **Impact:** While these appear to be legitimate cryptographic implementations, they should be reviewed for any hardcoded secrets
- **Locations:**
  - `src/age/no-op-encdec.ts` - filekey handling
  - `src/age/age-reader-writer.ts` - macKey operations
  - `src/age/stream-cipher.ts` - privateKey usage
- **Remediation:**
  - Audit all key-related code for hardcoded values
  - Ensure all cryptographic keys are properly generated or derived
  - Add documentation for key handling procedures

### 3. Missing Error Handling

- **Severity:** Minor
- **Category:** Code Quality
- **Description:** Some cryptographic operations lack comprehensive error handling
- **Location:** Various files in `src/age/` directory
- **Remediation:**
  - Add try-catch blocks around cryptographic operations
  - Implement proper error propagation
  - Add logging for security-relevant events

## üíÄ Dead Code Analysis

### Unused Dependencies
- **Status:** Unable to determine - depcheck results empty
- **Recommendation:** Run `npx depcheck` to identify unused dependencies

### Unused Code
- **Analysis:** No specific unused code identified in current scan
- **Recommendation:** Implement dead code elimination as part of build process

### Unused Imports
- **Status:** ESLint found 0 issues, suggesting imports are properly managed
- **Recommendation:** Continue monitoring with ESLint rules for unused imports

## üîÑ Refactoring Suggestions

### Code Quality Improvements

1. **Cryptographic Code Organization**
   - Centralize key management functions
